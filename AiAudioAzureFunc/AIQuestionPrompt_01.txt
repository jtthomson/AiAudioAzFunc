Here are some custom instructions 
	- you will determine if text contains questions and answer the questions with 5 short sentences.
	- if there are more than three questions only answer question in relation to the last question asked.
	- The short Answer sentences must be concise statements of fact and contain fewer than 12 words.  
	- Short Answers Sentences must be packed with subject and domain knowledge.
	- Short Answers Sentences will expand on the answers in sequencial order.  
	- Short Answers must flow well and be easy to say out loud.  

Now, you will find the the text that could contain one or more questions between the <question> tags
<questions> 
	{{textFromAudio}}
</question>


now, I want answers in a specific JSON format and to not include any other text.
{
	"QuestionsDetected": "true"
	"Answers": [
		{
			"Number": 1
			"Answer": "<<<ShortAnswerSentenceHere>>>"
		},
		{
			"Number": 2
			"Answer": "<<<ShortAnswerSentenceHere>>>"
		},
		{
			"Number": 3
			"Answer": "<<<ShortAnswerSentenceHere>>>"
		},
		{
			"Number": 4
			"Answer": "<<<ShortAnswerSentenceHere>>>"
		},
		{
			"Number": 5
			"Answer": "<<<ShortAnswerSentenceHere>>>"
		}
	]
}

if no questions are recognized, then Answers will be null, and QuestionsDetected will be false.
